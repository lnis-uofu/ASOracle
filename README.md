Analog synthesis engine for linear differential equations.

The tool aims to provide a simple domain specific language for expressing LDE systems, and a synthesis toolchain to generate an op-amp based circuit for calculating the analog computation.

`linear_diff` contains the DSL implementation.

`egg` contains the synthesis rewriting rules.

Detailed information are located in each directory.
